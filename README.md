## Getting Help with GameResourceBot
For help on any subject concerning GRB at any time while using GRB, type:  

	bot help

*NOTE: If your guild uses something other than the word "bot" to get GRB's attention, use that instead.*

If you can't use GRB because it doesn't yet exist on your Discord server, you're in luck! We have two--yes, TWO--different setup guides to assist you. Please continue to the next section.

## Setting Up GameResourceBot
- If you have never set up GRB on a Discord server before, then [Setting Up GameResourceBot - long version](./SETUP-long.md) is for you. Please go there now.
- If you have set up GRB on a Discord server before, you have a choice.
	- You may use the long version above, as you did before.
	- For the bare-bones basics, you may use [Setting Up GameResourceBot - short version](./SETUP-short.md) instead.

## Updating GameResourceBot
The GRB setup process referenced in the previous section is the same for everyone. The GRB update process is not.  
Which GRB update process you will use depends on the operating system your computer uses.  
Please click the link for the appropriate operating system.
- [MS Windows](./UPDATE-MSWin.md)
- [MacOS](./UPDATE-MacOS.md) - ***COMING SOON***

## Editor's Note
The main steps in the Setup files use sentence case.
The main steps in the Update files use all caps.
This is intentional. It provides a visual difference to assure users (especially first-timers and non-techies) they are using a different guide.
