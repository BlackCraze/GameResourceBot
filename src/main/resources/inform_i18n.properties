COMMENT_INFORM = The keys "INFO" and "CREDITS" should appear in this file because they are informational in nature. They're not here. Instead, they are in the `help_en.properties` file. This is because descriptive help text for those commands serves no purpose, and because it's easier to code the descriptive help system by keeping the text over there.
