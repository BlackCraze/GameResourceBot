COMMENT_HELP = Key "GENERAL" is listed first, for obvious reasons. All remaining keys follow, listed in alphabetical order.

COMMENT_HELP_FUTURE1 = When changing ANYTHING in this file, remember to make the same changes to `help_i18n.properties`. Add to that file any necessary comments for translators, then begin the translation process.

COMMENT_HELP_FUTURE2 = When adding a new top-level command to GRB, create descriptive help text for the command and all of its subcommands, if any. Maintain a style consistent with the existing help text, if possible. (Or, if you have something you think works better, use that and change the existing help text to match. The particular style used is not as important as presenting a consistent style. This helps users find information quickly.) Then create a new string key that matches the name of the command. Insert the key, together with your new text, in the proper alphabetical position.

COMMENT_HELP_FUTURE3 =  When adding a new subcommand to an existing command, create descriptive help text for the subcommand. Maintain consistent style (see above). Then add your new text in the most logical position within the existing string for the parent command.

# ***TRAN: DO translate the text in <angle brackets>, using the same translation both times. // 
COMMENT_HELP_FUTURE4 = If the need arises for descriptive help text for a feature that is neither a command nor a subcommand, create the text, maintaining consistent style (see above). Then create a new string key that is relevant to the feature and that does not duplicate an existing string key. Insert the key, together with your new text, in the proper alphabetical position. DO NOTHING ELSE. The Java code is already designed to display the text for string key <WHATEVER> in response to the command `bot help <WHATEVER>`, as long as the key exists in this file and its non-English counterparts.

Greetings! I am GameResourceBot (GameResourceBot), or GRB for short.\n\
\n\
I can understand only one command at a time.\n\
Commands are NOT case-sensitive, unless otherwise noted.\n\
DO NOT send one message with multiple commands on separate lines.\n\
DO send one message with one command, then another message, and so on.\n\
DO read the help for the command you want to use. Sometimes, I can do multiple tasks within one command.\n\
DO use the %2$s channel to communicate with me. It's the only channel where I have access.\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
To let me update your inventory, you may:\n\
+ post screenshots of your inventory screen. For details, type:\n\
```%1$s help screenshot```\n\
+ use commands. For details, type:\n\
```%1$s help update```\n\
\n\
# ***TRAN: Use Discord's specific term for "Direct Message" and for "@mention ID".\n\
OPTIONAL: Send commands and/or screenshots via Direct Message (DM): __Use my @mention ID.__\n\
\n\
OPTIONAL: When sending commands via DM, you may omit the `%1$s` prefix.\n\

CHECK = **Check** (Check)\n\
\n\
The *primary* purpose of the `check` command is to verify that I read your screenshots correctly.\n\
The *secondary* purpose of the `check` command is to search the database for all information that matches a search term you specify.\n\
\n\
\n\
**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\n\
ATTENTION\n\
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\n\
This is a complex command. This command gives two different types of output, depending on how you use it. In addition, the output of this command can be __VERY LONG__. Please take the time to understand the `check` command before you use it.\n\
\n\
*In most cases, you should use `%1$s total` instead.*\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
*Primary purpose*\n\
Check all of your own inventory.\n\
```%1$s check```\n\
\n\
OUTPUT: a list of all resource types currently in your inventory list in my database, __plus__ the quantity you have on hand of each type, __plus__ how long ago you updated each resource type.\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
*Primary purpose*\n\
Check all of one other user's inventory.\n\
# ***TRAN: DO translate the text in [brackets].\n\
```%1$s check [userName]```\n\
# ***TRAN: DO translate the words in camelCase.\n\
__The `userName` must be spelled correctly.\n\
The `userName` must be an exact match.__ For more information, type:\n\
```%1$s help users```\n\
\n\
OUTPUT: a list of all resource types currently in `userName`'s inventory list in my database, __plus__ the quantity `userName` has on hand of each type, __plus__ how long ago `userName` updated each resource type.\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
*Primary purpose* **AND** *Secondary purpose*\n\
Check all items, __anywhere__ in my database, that match a search term you specify.\n\
__The `searchTerm` may appear *anywhere* in a name, and it is *not* case-sensitive.__\n\
```%1$s check [searchTerm]```\n\
\n\
\n\
OUTPUT (PART 1): a list of all users who currently have on hand any non-zero quantity of a resource type matching the `searchTerm`, __plus__ the quantity of that resource type each user has on hand, __plus__ how long ago each user updated that resource type, __plus__ the total quantity of that resource type currently held by the entire guild.\n\
\n\
If more than one resource type matches `searchTerm`, I will show you OUTPUT (PART 1) __separately__ for __each__ matching resource type.\n\
__Example__: `searchTerm` "alumin" will match Aluminium AND Aluminium Bar AND Aluminium Bottle.\n\
\n\
\n\
OUTPUT (PART 2): a list of all resource types currently in the inventory list for a user whose `userName` contains the `searchTerm`, __plus__ the quantity that user has on hand of each type, __plus__ how long ago that user updated each resource type.\n\
__This is identical to the output of `%1$s check [userName]`.__\n\
\n\
If more than one `userName` contains `searchTerm`, I will show you OUTPUT (PART 2) __separately__ for __each__ such user.\n\

SCREENSHOT = **Uploading Screenshots**\n\
IMPORTANT: __There is no `%1$s screenshot` command. This information is to assist you with the process of uploading screenshots to get the best results.__\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
To update your inventory using screenshots:\n\
1) Ensure your language setting matches the language of your screenshots. For details, type:\n\
```%1$s help userConfig```\n\
\n\
2) Turn off any software screen filters you have running. In particular, blue light filters make me go blind. (After you take the screenshots, feel free to turn on your filters again, if you like.)\n\
\n\
3) Use your preferred method to take screenshots of your inventory screen in the game.\n\
+ Both the resource name and the amount must be clearly visible.\n\
+ Android - recommended app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shamanland.privatescreenshots\n\
\n\
4) Keep all screenshots in their original size.\n\
+ DO NOT CROP IMAGES!! My ability to read screenshots depends on seeing the full screen.\n\
\n\
5) Save all screenshots as PNG files. (Hint: That probably happens automatically.) If you do not know the file type of your screenshots, then upload them, anyway. If they're not PNG files, I will tell you.\n\
\n\
6) In your Discord app, go to the %2$s channel (or Direct Message) and upload the images.\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
Occasionally, you may want me to ignore a resource in your inventory. For example, you may be saving something that is needed to upgrade a building, making it unavailable for the guild to use.\n\
\n\
There are two different ways to handle this situation.\n\
__Method #1__: Before uploading the screenshot that shows the resource you want to keep, use a photo editor to edit the screenshot. Scribble over the resource to make it impossible for me to read it.\n\
__Method #2__: Upload the unaltered screenshot. Then use a command to delete the resource. For details, type:\n\
```%1$s help clear```\n\
\n\
**==========**\n\
\n\
__TIPS__\n\
+ You may upload screenshots to update your entire inventory at once, or only part of your inventory.\n\
+ When updating your inventory, I will __always__:\n\
	+ ADD each resource in your screenshots to your inventory list, unless the resource is already there from a previous update.\n\
	+ REPLACE the old amount of each resource with the new amount.\n\
+ When updating your inventory, I will __never__ remove a resource from your inventory list.\n\
+ Example:\n\
__old inventory list__\n\
coal 5,000\n\
copper 10,000\n\
\n\
__new screenshot__\n\
coal 7,000\n\
iron 12,000\n\
\n\
__new inventory list__\n\
coal 7,000\n\
copper 10,000\n\
iron 12,000\n\
\n\
If all your copper were gone, your new inventory list would be inaccurate.\n\
To prevent errors like this, send `%1$s clear` BEFORE updating your __entire__ inventory.\n\
\n\
